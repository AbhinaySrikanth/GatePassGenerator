---

## Features

- Secure admin login and password management
- Add, view, and manage visitor entries
- Dashboard with quick access to core functions

---

## Prerequisites

- PHP (version 5.6 or newer recommended)
- MySQL or MariaDB server
- A web server (e.g., Apache, included with XAMPP, WAMP, etc.)

---

## Installation

1. **Download and Extract**
   - Download the project files and place them in your web serverâ€™s root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP, `www` for WAMP).

2. **Database Setup**
   - Locate the provided database PHP file (e.g., `database.php`). This file contains the SQL structure and/or connection logic.
   - If you have an SQL file, import it into your MySQL server using phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line.
   - If the database is created via PHP, ensure you run the script once to set up the required tables.

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Open the configuration file (commonly named `config.php` or `database.php`).
   - Set your database host, username, password, and database name as needed.
   - Example:
     ```php
     $conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "visitor_db");
     ```
   - Save the file.

4. **Start Services**
   - Ensure Apache and MySQL services are running (use XAMPP or WAMP control panel).

5. **Access the Application**
   - In your browser, go to `http://localhost/your-folder-name/`.

## Troubleshooting
